Engineering decides to go ahead and implement the POC for a hotel reservation system. 

As the first iteration,  ENG will create a search and master/detail page with CRUD features.

The following are the requirement
1.	Engineering MUST use Visual Studio Code with Angular and its Angular Material for GUI
2.	Engineering MUST use the reactive form to implement reservation.
3.	Engineering needs to create a search page with search criteria and a result table. (check reservation.json for required data (2 entries))
4.	Engineering needs to create a popup dialog to display the detail reservation (check GUI.png for UI sketch)
5.	Engineering MUST create a service object with HTTPClient to load 2 entries from reservation.json into memory and manage search logic.
6.	Engineering MUST create relevant component objects to display search criteria, search result and detail reservations by double-clicking the search result.
7.	Engineering MUST apply Observable, Subscription, async / await from RXJS.
8.	Engineering MUST apply the standard Angular coding style guide throughout the implementation.
9.	Engineering MUST create Karma/Jasmine unit test for each service and component objects. Each public functions in service and component object need be covered. We expect at least 80% code coverage. 
10.	Engineering MUST use ESLint to find and address all Lint-related issues.
11.	Engineering MUST use playwright to do an e2e automation test.
12.	Engineering MUST use GitHub to store the project and use a GitHub CI/CD pipeline to build, run unit tests, run ESLint, and execute the e2e. 
13.	Please forward the GitHub link to us.
